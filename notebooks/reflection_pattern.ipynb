       "**Code Critique:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Naming Conventions:** Your naming conventions are mostly correct, but there is a slight inconsistency. You've used both camelCase (`alreadySorted`) and underscore notation (`bubble_sort`) for function and variable names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. Python's PEP 8 style guide recommends using underscore notation for function and variable names.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Function Documentation:** You've provided a good explanation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in the comments, but it would be more helpful to include a docstring within the function itself. This docstring should explain the purpose of the function, its parameters, and its return value.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Code Readability:** The code is generally easy to read, but the inner loop could be improved for readability. You could consider extracting the swapping logic into a separate function or using a more descriptive variable name instead of `j`.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Recommendations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Consistent Naming:** Change `already_sorted` to `alreadySorted` to maintain consistent naming conventions.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Add Docstring:** Add a docstring to the `bubble_sort` function to provide a clear explanation of its purpose, parameters, and return value.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Extract Swapping Logic:** Consider extracting the swapping logic into a separate function, such as `swap_elements`, to improve code readability and maintainability.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Use Descriptive Variable Names:** Instead of using `j` as the variable name in the inner loop, consider using a more descriptive name like `current_index` or `element_index` to improve code readability.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Error Handling:** While not necessary for the correctness of the algorithm, it's a good practice to include some error handling to ensure the function can handle unexpected input. For example, you could add a check to ensure the input is a list.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   The `bubble_sort` function takes an array as input and returns the sorted array.\n",
      "*   The outer loop iterates `n-1` times, where `n` is the length of the array.\n",
      "*   The inner loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n",
      "*   A flag `swapped` is used to check if any swaps were made in the inner loop. If no swaps were made, the array is sorted, and the function can terminate early.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Time Complexity\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Best case: O(n) when the input array is already sorted.\n",
      "*   Worst case: O(n^2) when the input array is sorted in reverse order.\n",
      "*   Average case: O(n^2) for random input arrays.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Space Complexity\n",
      "\n",
      "*   O(1) because only a single additional memory space is required for the temporary swap variable.\n",

      "REFLECTION\n",
      "\n",
      " **Code Review and Recommendations**\n",
      "\n",
      "The provided implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in Python is well-structured and easy to understand. However, here are some critiques and recommendations for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Variable Naming**:\n",
      "    *   The variable `n` could be more descriptive. Consider renaming it to `array_length` for better clarity.\n",
      "    *   The variable `arr` could be renamed to something like `input_array` or `numbers` for improved readability.\n",
      "2.  **Type Hinting**:\n",
      "    *   The function `bubble_sort` should include type hints for the input parameter `arr` and the return type. This enhances code readability and helps catch type-related errors.\n",
      "3.  **Input Validation**:\n",
      "    *   The function `bubble_sort` does not validate its input. Consider adding checks to ensure that the input is a list and contains only comparable elements (e.g., numbers or strings).\n",
      "4.  **Commenting and Documentation**:\n",
      "    *   While the code has a clear and concise docstring for the `bubble_sort` function, the comments within the code could be more descriptive. Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of the `swapped` flag and the optimization it provides.\n",
      "5.  **Main Function**:\n",
      "    *   The `main` function is well-structured, but it could be improved by including a brief description of its purpose in a docstring.\n",
      "6.  **Error Handling**:\n",
      "    *   The code does not handle potential errors that might occur during execution, such as an input array containing non-comparable elements. Consider adding try-except blocks to handle these scenarios.\n",
      "7.  **Example Usage**:\n",

       "**Updated Implementation with Additional Recommendations**\n",
       "\n",
       "The updated implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in Python has addressed several of the critiques and recommendations provided. However, here are some additional suggestions to further improve the code:\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. **Unit Tests**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   The code should include unit tests to verify its correctness. Python's built-in `unittest` module can be used to create and run tests.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. **Error Handling**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   The code currently raises a `ValueError` if the input array is empty or contains non-comparable elements. However, it does not handle other potential errors that might occur during execution. Consider adding try-except blocks to handle these scenarios.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. **Type Hinting for the `main` Function**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   The `main` function should include type hints for its return type, which is `None` in this case.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. **Additional Test Cases**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   The example usage in the `main` function could be more comprehensive. Consider including additional test cases with different input arrays to demonstrate the algorithm's correctness and robustness.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 5. **Docstrings for the `main` Function**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   The `main` function should include a more detailed docstring that explains its purpose and the example usage it demonstrates.\n",
       "\n",
