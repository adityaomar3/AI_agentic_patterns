       "**Code Critique:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Naming Conventions:** Your naming conventions are mostly correct, but there is a slight inconsistency. You've used both camelCase (`alreadySorted`) and underscore notation (`bubble_sort`) for function and variable names. It's better to stick to a single convention throughout the code. Python's PEP 8 style guide recommends using underscore notation for function and variable names.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Function Documentation:** You've provided a good explanation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in the comments, but it would be more helpful to include a docstring within the function itself. This docstring should explain the purpose of the function, its parameters, and its return value.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Code Readability:** The code is generally easy to read, but the inner loop could be improved for readability. You could consider extracting the swapping logic into a separate function or using a more descriptive variable name instead of `j`.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Recommendations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Consistent Naming:** Change `already_sorted` to `alreadySorted` to maintain consistent naming conventions.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Add Docstring:** Add a docstring to the `bubble_sort` function to provide a clear explanation of its purpose, parameters, and return value.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Extract Swapping Logic:** Consider extracting the swapping logic into a separate function, such as `swap_elements`, to improve code readability and maintainability.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Use Descriptive Variable Names:** Instead of using `j` as the variable name in the inner loop, consider using a more descriptive name like `current_index` or `element_index` to improve code readability.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Error Handling:** While not necessary for the correctness of the algorithm, it's a good practice to include some error handling to ensure the function can handle unexpected input. For example, you could add a check to ensure the input is a list.\n",
